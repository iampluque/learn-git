  Rebase & Squash:
      Let's you rebase and lean your history before merging.
      
  The following session will result in...

  1.  A base commit on master
  2.  A first feature from master
  3.  A second feature from master modifying the same file than the first feature
  4.  Merge of the first feature in master
  5.  Merge of the second feature in master
steps:
- title: readme.md creation to master
  commands: |
    echo "2020 Release Notes" >> readme.md
    git add . &> /dev/null
    git commit -am "release notes" &> /dev/null
  outputs: |
    mastersHead=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
- title: Deving feature 1
  commands: |
    git checkout -b feature-1 $mastersHead &> /dev/null
    { echo "2019 Release Notes"; cat readme.md; } > temp && mv temp readme.md
    git commit -am "modifications from feature 1" &> /dev/null
    echo -n "Random changes" >> feature1.random.file
    git add . &> /dev/null
    git commit -am "random modifications from feature 1" &> /dev/null
- title: Adding random file to master
  commands: |
    git checkout master &> /dev/null
    echo -n "Random changes" >> random.file
    git add . &> /dev/null
    git commit -am "random modifications from master" &> /dev/null
- title: Merge feature 1 to master
  commands: |
    git checkout feature-1 &> /dev/null
        cat << EOF

        Now, 

        1.  Open another console from the current console
        2.  Run the following. 
            
            cd demo
            git rebase --interactive master

        5.  A list of commits since the upstream will be shown in VI in the following format: <verb> <commit's sha> <commit message>.
            Press i to enter edition mode.
            From the second commit to the last, replace pick verb by squash (or it's short version s).
        6.  When your done, press Esc to exit edition mode.
            Then type :wq to write content and quit vi.
        7.  A new vi will open so you can add you commit message. Insert it at the first line (e.g.: Adding feature 1). Save and quit.
        8.  When your ready, exit the previously created console and press any key, will resume the work!
    EOF

    git checkout master &> /dev/null
    git merge feature-1 &> /dev/null
